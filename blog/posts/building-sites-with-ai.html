      <h2>Building Websites with AI Tools</h2>
      <p class="meta">Published August&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2025</p>
      <p>AI has democratized website creation. Platforms like generative design assistants and code‑completion engines mean you no longer have to be a seasoned developer to build something beautiful. In this post I’ll walk you through some of my favourite tools and workflows.</p>
      <p>We’ll explore using AI to generate color palettes, build out responsive layouts and even write content outlines. I’ll share tips on when to rely on automation versus when to take the reins yourself, ensuring the final result reflects your vision.</p>
      <p>This very site is an example: the design was sketched out with the help of AI, while the finishing touches — like this article — were handcrafted. The combination of speed and human nuance makes AI tools incredibly powerful for independent creators.</p>
      <p>By the end of this guide you’ll have a roadmap for launching your own AI‑assisted websites quickly and efficiently.</p>
