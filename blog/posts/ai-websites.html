    <h1>How I Use AI to Build Websites</h1>

    <p>Artificial intelligence has revolutionised the way we create websites. From designing layouts to generating imagery, AI tools help me iterate quickly and focus on the creative aspects of building digital experiences. In this post I’ll share my workflow for using AI to develop websites like this one.</p>
    <p>First, I use large language models to scaffold the structure of a site. By describing the desired sections, pages and style, I can generate boilerplate HTML and CSS. Then I refine the output manually, ensuring accessibility and semantic markup.</p>
    <p>Next, I harness generative image models to produce unique graphics. Instead of relying solely on stock photos, I can describe a concept—like a futuristic crypto landscape—and have a bespoke image generated in seconds. These visuals make each site feel distinctive while reducing cost.</p>
    <p>Finally, I use AI‑powered search and analysis to optimise SEO. Tools can suggest meta descriptions, keyword placements and even gauge readability. The result is a website that not only looks great but is discoverable on search engines.</p>
    <p>AI isn’t a replacement for human creativity; it’s a powerful collaborator. By embracing these tools, I can build more in less time and explore ideas that would have been costly or labour‑intensive before.</p>
