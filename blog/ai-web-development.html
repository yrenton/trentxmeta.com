      <h2>Exploring AI in Web Development</h2>
      <p class="meta">Published September&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2025</p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a buzzword reserved for science fiction. In recent years it has permeated every aspect of technology — including the way we design and develop websites. As a web developer who leans heavily on AI, I’m excited by how intelligent tools can accelerate workflows, automate repetitive tasks and unlock new creative possibilities.</p>
      <p>From AI‑powered design assistants that suggest layouts and color palettes, to code generation tools that scaffold full sites from simple prompts, the future of web development is being reshaped by machine learning. These systems are far from replacing human developers but they can augment our capabilities, freeing us up to focus on strategy, storytelling and fine‑tuning user experiences.</p>
      <p>On this site you’ll see many examples of AI assistance in action — including the very pages you’re reading. I use AI to generate content outlines, create images and even help with code snippets. This synergy between human creativity and machine intelligence allows me to build polished websites faster than ever.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more deep dives into the tools I use and how you can integrate AI into your own projects.</p>
