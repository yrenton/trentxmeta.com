# TrentXMeta.com

This repository contains the source code for **TrentXMeta.com**, the personal website of Trent — a crypto enthusiast, AI‑powered web developer, and content creator.  

The site is a simple, static build that’s easy to deploy on GitHub Pages.  It features:

* A home page with a short biography and a gallery of artwork.
* A blog section with a search box and three sample posts.
* Simple styling for a clean dark theme.
* Meta tags for better SEO and social sharing.
* A `sitemap.xml` and `feed.xml` for search engines and feed readers.

You can customize the content by editing the HTML files, adjust the styling in **assets/css/style.css**, and add or remove blog posts under **blog/posts/**.
